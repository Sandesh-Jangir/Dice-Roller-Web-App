# Dice-Roller-Web-App
This is a simple, friendly front-end application that "Rolls Dice," or, in technical terms, generates a random integer in the range 1 - 6. Based on the biases of the generated number, a `DOM id` is fetched from a custom-made JS Object with the generated numbers as keys and the DOM IDs concerning the number, and hence, the dice are rolled.

- And of course, all the logic is written in javascript :)
