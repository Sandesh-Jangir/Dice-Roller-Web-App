# Dice-Roller-Web-App
A simple friendly frontend application which "Rolls Dice" or in technical terms, generate a random integer in the range 1 - 6 and on the baises of the generated number, a `DOM id` is fetched from a custom made JS Object with the generated-numbers as keays and the DOM ids with respect to the number and hence the dice is rolled.

- And of course all the logic is written in javascript :)
